# The cSVD regression tests

This tree holds the Deno tests that name cSVD content or pin a number only the
committed cSVD data produces: 79 genes on 21 chromosomes, CENPF's row, HTRA1's
CARASIL identifiers, the radar's four sectors and nine empty cells, the PubMed
citation of PMID 37063705. `main` keeps them because they are the recorded
method; everything outside this tree holds for any disease and passes on
`deno task data:empty`.

A repository generated for another disease deletes the four trees in one go:

```bash
git rm -r tests/csvd e2e/tests/csvd tests/pipeline/csvd tests/scripts/csvd
```
