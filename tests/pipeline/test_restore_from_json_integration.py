"""scripts/restore_from_json.py against a real PostgreSQL.

The restore exists for the day the database is gone and `data/*.json` is the
only copy left, so its contract is the export's: what it writes must export
back to the committed files byte for byte. A mocked connection cannot say
that -- the first live restore failed on a `VARCHAR(20)` the export's own
label does not fit -- so these run against the `database_env` fixture, which
is why they live here rather than beside the script's unit tests in
`tests/scripts/`.

The throwaway database is shared by the whole session and the other
integration tests leave `pipeline_runs` rows behind, so every test here
starts from empty tables. Never point `CSVD_TEST_DB_URL` at a database you
want to keep; that is true of every test that uses it.
