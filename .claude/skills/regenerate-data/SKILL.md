name: regenerate-data
description: Use when regenerating data/*.json (deno task data, deno task geocode, or --export at the end of a pipeline run), backing up or restoring the production database, working out which PostgreSQL is serving (the native Homebrew postgresql@18 that holds the data, versus the throwaway dhi.io/postgres:18-alpine3.23 container tests use), rebuilding a database from scratch, or drawing the print figures and cytobands (deno task figure, deno task cytobands).

# Regenerating the data

Data regeneration (needs PostgreSQL reachable and `.env` populated — see
`.env.example`):

```bash
deno task data      # pipeline/export/main.py    → everything except the map
deno task geocode   # pipeline/export/geocode.py → data/geocoded_trials.json
```

`--export` does the same work as `deno task data` at the end of a live pipeline
run (`uv run python -m pipeline.main --clinical-trials --export`), leaving the
files in the working tree. `deno task geocode` stays separate either way — it
calls out to clinicaltrials.gov — so a run that adds a trial needs it too, or
`tests/data_contract_test.ts` fails on the `nctIds` set.

## Two databases, and they are not interchangeable

**Production is a native Homebrew `postgresql@18` binary installation.
Containers are for testing only**, and they run under Apple's macOS-native
`container`, not Docker — Docker Desktop is not installed. The two servers are
never the same and never swap roles:

| | Production | Testing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Where | Native Homebrew `postgresql@18` | Throwaway `container` PostgreSQL |
| Data directory | `/opt/homebrew/var/postgresql@18` | None — no volume, nothing survives |
| Reached by | The `.env` credentials on `localhost:5432` | The `database_env` fixture, at the container's own address |
| Lifetime | Permanent; holds the curated data | Created and destroyed per test session |

Production is managed with `brew services {start,stop,restart} postgresql@18`.
The formula is **keg-only, so its client tools are not on `PATH`** —
`pg_isready`, `psql` and `pg_dump` all read "command not found" until you add
them:

```bash
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/postgresql@18/bin:$PATH"
```

**No test may touch the production database**, which is what
`_isolate_credentials` in `tests/pipeline/conftest.py` enforces by clearing
`DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER` and `DB_PASSWORD` outright. A test
wanting real SQL asks for the `database_env` fixture, which brings the
container up as `csvd-pg-pytest`, migrates it to head, and destroys it with the
session. It publishes no port: `container` gives the container **its own
address** on the `default` network, so it answers on 5432 there and cannot
shadow the production server on the host's 5432. See "Database tests" in
`pipeline/CLAUDE.md`.

**An empty container list says nothing about production.** `container list` and
`container volume list` describe only the testing shape; the native server is
invisible to them. Reading an empty `container list` as "the database is gone"
is a mistake this file exists to prevent — check the real one instead:

```bash
ps aux | grep '[p]ostgres'   # the native server names its data directory
pg_isready -h localhost -p 5432
```

## The test container image

The runtime is **Apple's `container`** (`brew install container`;
`container system start` if `container system status` says otherwise). The
image is **`dhi.io/postgres:18.6`** — a
[Docker Hardened Image](https://docs.docker.com/dhi/), pulled from `dhi.io`
after `container registry login dhi.io`, not Docker Hub's `postgres:18.6`:

```bash
container image pull dhi.io/postgres:18.6
container run --detach --name csvd-pg \
  --env POSTGRES_USER=csvd_user --env POSTGRES_PASSWORD=… \
  --env POSTGRES_DB=csvd_dashboard \
  --volume csvd-pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/18/data \
  dhi.io/postgres:18.6
cd pipeline && uv run alembic upgrade head
```

**Do not run that recipe on a machine that already has the native server.** It
stands up a second, empty database under the production database's own name and
user; point `.env` at its address and that reads as a wiped database. It is
here to document the image, and for a machine that has no native PostgreSQL at
all. The test fixture uses **`dhi.io/postgres:18-alpine3.23`**, not this image,
and none of these settings: its own container name, no volume, and the address
`container` assigns it. The last bullet below is why the two differ.

Four things about it are load-bearing:

- **`container` publishes nothing onto the host.** Each container gets its own
  address on the `default` network — `container list` prints it, and
  `container inspect <name>` reports it under `status.networks` in CIDR form.
  There is no `container port` subcommand. That is why the recipe above has no
  `-p` and why nothing it runs can collide with `localhost:5432`.

- **`PGDATA` is `/var/lib/postgresql/18/data`, not the official image's
  `/var/lib/postgresql/18/docker`.** A volume left at the old path leaves the
  container initializing an empty database beside it, which reads as a wiped
  schema rather than as a misplaced mount. It also runs as non-root (uid 70), so
  a _bind_ mount needs `chown 70:70`; the named volume above needs nothing.
- **Alpine is not the lighter alternative.** `postgres:18.6-alpine` measured
  _worse_ on the severities that matter — 3 critical and 27 high against
  `postgres:18.6`'s 2 and 23 — because the CVEs are in openssl and the vendored
  Go stdlib, not in the base OS the Alpine variant trims. The hardened image
  reports 0 critical, 0 high and 0 medium. Those numbers came from
  `docker scout quickview <image>`; re-measure rather than assuming, with
  whatever scanner is at hand — `container` ships none.
- **It is Debian and glibc**, collating `en_US.UTF-8` through the libc provider
  as the official image does. That is what makes it a drop-in for an existing
  data directory; a musl image would silently reorder every text index instead.
  That is why **this** recipe pins `18.6`, and it is a constraint about a
  mounted `PGDATA` rather than about the image as such. The pytest fixture
  mounts no volume and initdb's a fresh cluster every session, so it has no data
  directory to collate compatibly with, and it runs
  `dhi.io/postgres:18-alpine3.23` — the musl image, which is the one on disk.
  Both serve PostgreSQL 18.6. `PGDATA` there is
  `/var/lib/postgresql/18/data/pgdata`, one level deeper than here. Do not swap
  either image for the other: this recipe would reorder an existing index, and
  the fixture would skip every database test on an image that is not pulled.

## What can be rebuilt, and the one thing that cannot

"Regenerating the database" is two different jobs. The schema is fully
scripted; the data is not.

**Schema — one command.** Alembic reads `.env` itself
(`pipeline/alembic/env.py:22`), so nothing needs exporting first:

```bash
cd pipeline && uv run alembic upgrade head
```

Run it on an existing database too before the first `deno task data` after the
`disease-reuse` branch merges: migration 014 renames
`clinical_trials.svd_population` to `target_population`, and the export, the
merge and the clinical-trials sync all read the new name.

From nothing, that is preceded by `createuser -s csvd_user` and
`createdb -O csvd_user csvd_dashboard`. Note that `csvd_user` is **not** a
superuser and cannot create databases, so those two run as the macOS user.
Migrations 001-009 build the whole schema and **none of them seeds any data**.

**Data — mostly scripted, with one hole:**

| Table | Rebuilt by | Cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `clinical_trials` | `--clinical-trials` | free |
| NCBI / UniProt / PubMed caches | `--sync-external-data` | free |
| `gene_annotations` | `--sync-annotations` | free, ~30 min |
| `pubmed_refs` | accrues from `--pubmed` runs | **paid re-extraction** |
| `pipeline_runs` | accrues naturally | — |
| **`genes` (63 curated rows)** | **nothing — no path exists** | — |

**The curated `genes` table cannot be regenerated.** No migration seeds it, no
script imports it, and `scripts/` has no importer: those rows are curator
judgement that entered upstream of this repo from the source spreadsheet. The
only copy outside the database is the published projection in
`data/table1.json`, and that is lossy — `source_quote` is held out by
`_UNPUBLISHED_COLUMNS` (`pipeline/export/main.py`), as are the id and timestamp
columns.

**So a dump is the backstop, and it is the only one.** It also protects
`pubmed_refs`, the ledger whose loss makes the next `--days-back` run re-extract
papers already paid for:

```bash
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/postgresql@18/bin:$PATH"
pg_dump -h localhost -U csvd_user -Fc csvd_dashboard > ~/csvd_dashboard_$(date +%F).dump
pg_restore -h localhost -U csvd_user -d csvd_dashboard --clean ~/csvd_dashboard_<date>.dump
```

Verify a dump rather than trusting it — restore into a scratch database and
compare, because matching row counts do not prove matching content:

```sql
SELECT md5(string_agg(t::text, '|' ORDER BY id)) FROM genes t;
```

`filter.ids` fetches every trial's locations in one request, so
`deno task geocode` no longer needs a cache or a rate limit.

`deno task figure` draws both figures for print — the trials timeline with
`scripts/timeline_figure.py` (pyCirclize) and the phenogram with
`scripts/phenogram_figure.py` (matplotlib). It runs through
`uv run --group figure`, which installs the group itself, and writes
`figures/{timeline,phenogram}.{svg,pdf,png}`, which are not committed.
`deno task cytobands` regenerates `data/cytobands_hg38.json` from UCSC; that
file _is_ committed, like every other `data/*.json`.
