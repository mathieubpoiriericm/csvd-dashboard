"""Rebuild the database from the committed data/*.json.

For the day PostgreSQL is gone and no dump survives -- 2026-11-02, when a
Homebrew reinstall deleted /opt/homebrew/var/postgresql@18 and the formula's
post-install initdb'd an empty cluster in its place. A `pg_dump` is still the
backstop (the regenerate-data skill); this is the second one, and it only
holds while data/ is current: anything merged since the last export is not
in the files and does not come back.

    uv run python -m scripts.restore_from_json            # build and check only
    uv run python -m scripts.restore_from_json --write    # into an empty database

The database must exist and be at `alembic upgrade head`; `--write` refuses
if any table it writes already holds a row.

**Every row is checked before anything is written.** Each genes and
clinical_trials row is pushed back through the export's own
`clean_gene_row` / `clean_trial_row`, and the restore refuses unless the
result is the committed row exactly -- so an export step this module failed
to invert is a refusal, not a silently different dataset. Re-running
`run_export` against the result reproduces every file it writes byte for
byte (tests/pipeline/test_restore_from_json_integration.py).

What comes back, and from where:

- genes and its three join tables, from table1.json -- source_quote and
  confidence included, since both are published.
- clinical_trials, from table2.json: the curated rows only. The export never
  publishes an uncurated ClinicalTrials.gov discovery (`--clinical-trials`
  fetches those again) or a TERMINATED / WITHDRAWN trial, whose curator
  columns survive only in a table2.json committed before 1299cd7 -- in the
  pre-squash history the regenerate-data skill describes.
- The NCBI, UniProt and PubMed caches, from gene_info*.json, protein_info.json
  and refs.json. `ncbi_gene_info.map_location` and UniProt's GO columns are
  not published, so they stay NULL until `--sync-external-data`.
- pipeline_runs, from pipeline_run.json and pipeline_status.json -- only the
  runs those two files describe, a preview run's report left out: it ran
  against a database of its own -- and sync_runs from pipeline_syncs.json.
- pubmed_refs, the processed-PMID ledger, from the run reports under the
  gitignored logs/ rather than from data/: logs/json/pipeline_report_*.json
  and the pipeline_completed events in logs/events.db, a preview run's
  reports left out as well, so a real run still takes its papers. A paper processed by
  a run older than every surviving report is missing, and the next window
  that covers it re-extracts it -- unless a later run's skipped count says
  how many there were and its query names them (the regenerate-data skill).

What does not: ids and timestamps (rows are renumbered in file order, which
is the order the export reads them in), gene_annotations (empty until
`--sync-annotations`; the export keeps the committed gene_annotations.json
meanwhile), and every spelling the export normalises -- trait synonyms come
back folded, "ALL" in the cell types lowercased, the omics prose in the shape
the export splits it from.

Run it as a module, not as a path: `uv run scripts/...` puts scripts/ on
sys.path rather than the repo root, and the pipeline imports below would not
resolve.
