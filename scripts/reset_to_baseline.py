"""Reset the genes to a curated baseline before a re-extraction.

For the day the extraction method changes enough that nothing the old one
merged should stand -- 2026-11-02, when extraction moved from Claude Opus 5 with
prompt v6 to Opus 5.5 with v7 and every value the pipeline had ever merged
came from the old pair. The merge only adds (references append, a placeholder
protein is filled, MR flips No to Yes, a quote and its confidence fill an empty
pair), so a new run over the same papers cannot take the old method's values
back out. This puts the table back where it stood before the old method's first
merge, so the next run's window is extracted by one method alone.

    uv run python -m scripts.reset_to_baseline --baseline PATH            # check
    uv run python -m scripts.reset_to_baseline --baseline PATH --write    # reset

PATH is a data/table1.json committed before the first merge -- for this
dataset, `a5915b4:data/table1.json` in the pre-squash history the
regenerate-data skill describes. It is converted to today's wire format first:
the provenance columns (published since) are appended at their sentinels, and a
protein the export of the day published as the gene symbol becomes
"(unknown)".

**Nothing is written unless two checks hold for every baseline row.**

- It round-trips: through `gene_from_wire` and back through `clean_gene_row`
  it reproduces itself exactly -- the refusal `scripts.restore_from_json`
  uses, so an export step this cannot invert is a refusal and not a silently
  different dataset.
- The live table holds it plus additions only: every list element it has is
  still there, MR is unchanged or No became Yes, a "(unknown)" protein may now
  be named, an absent quote or confidence may now be filled, and every other
  field is identical. Anything else is a curator's change made after the
  baseline, and losing it is the one outcome a reset must never have.

A baseline row that already carries a quote or a confidence is refused too:
that is an extraction, not curation. So is a live gene the baseline lacks
unless it carries both: the pipeline inserts a gene with the quote and the
confidence it was extracted with, so a row missing either was added some other
way -- by a curator, after the baseline -- and the reset would delete it.

**With --write, one transaction**, which waits for any pipeline run between
its gene merge and its ledger write to finish both, then re-runs the check
under a lock on the genes and its three list tables, so nothing can land
between the check and the write: every genes row is deleted (the three list
tables cascade) and the baseline inserted with the restore's own
`insert_genes`; pubmed_refs is emptied, so the next run treats every paper in
its window as new; and the annotation rows and fetch statuses of every gene
symbol outside the baseline are deleted, because `--sync-annotations` replaces
only the genes it fetches and the export publishes the table whole. Trials, the
lookup caches, the annotations of the kept genes and the run and refresh
history are left alone: none of them is extracted.

Before anything else the target is printed from the environment -- `.env` is
loaded without override, so an exported DB_* variable wins and any one left
unset comes from `.env`. Read it before passing --write. Take a `pg_dump` first
and rehearse on a copy (the regenerate-data skill).

Run it as a module, not as a path: `uv run scripts/...` puts scripts/ on
sys.path rather than the repo root, and the imports below would not resolve.

    its genes and records their papers in `pubmed_refs` in two

    between them deleted the merged genes, and the run's ledger write then
    marked their papers processed, so no later run retried them. The run

    exclusive here, before the table lock, waits for that window to close,
