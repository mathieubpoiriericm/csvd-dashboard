# Cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD)

The disease this repository's `disease/` describes. Everything on this page is a
measurement of the cSVD dataset the dashboard was built on; the code, the
pipeline and the tests outside the four `csvd/` trees hold for any disease.

## What the dashboard holds

| File                    | Rows             | Source                              |
| ----------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `table1.json`           | 79 genes         | `genes` table (+ three join tables) |
| `table2.json`           | 102 trial rows   | `clinical_trials` table (curated)   |
| `gene_info.json`        | 79               | `ncbi_gene_info` cache              |
| `gene_info_table2.json` | 26               | `ncbi_gene_info` cache              |
| `protein_info.json`     | 79               | `uniprot_info` cache                |
| `refs.json`             | 111 citations    | `pubmed_citations` cache            |
| `omim_info.json`        | 49               | `disease/omim_info.csv`             |
| `gene_annotations.json` | 171              | `gene_annotations` table (pivoted)  |
| `pipeline_syncs.json`   | 3 (one per mode) | `sync_runs` table                   |
| `geocoded_trials.json`  | 378 sites        | ClinicalTrials.gov                  |
| `cytobands_hg38.json`   | 862 bands        | UCSC Genome Browser                 |

The 102 curated trial rows are 65 drugs across 82 registered trials, 77 of them
on ClinicalTrials.gov, which is where the 378 map sites in 23 countries come
from. `timeline.json` names 51 curated mechanisms of action grouped into 14
families; the rows themselves use 46 of the mechanisms. The karyogram draws the
21 chromosomes that carry a gene.

### Traits

The 16 canonical phenotypes in `vocabulary.json`, by family. Each carries its
STRIVE-2 definition, an ontology cross-reference (or an explicit `null` with the
reason), and synonyms; nine more prompt terms are listed as deliberately
untracked.

| Key              | Name                                                        | Family      |

| `stroke`         | Stroke                                                      | `stroke`    |
| `lacunar stroke` | Lacunar stroke                                              | `stroke`    |

| `lacunes`        | Lacunes (of presumed vascular origin)                       | `lacunes`   |

### Populations

The trials are filed under four populations (`manifest.json`, `populations`),
shown on the trials pages as the "SVD Population" column: **CAA**, **Cognitive
Impairment**, **Stroke** and **SVD** -- the last labelled "Any SVD (including
monogenic)" on the radar.

## The PubMed query

`SVD_QUERY` in `pipeline/pubmed_search.py` is built from the search terms in
`pipeline.json`, and its recall is measured rather than assumed.
`tests/pipeline/csvd/test_query_recall.py` intersects it with a `[uid]`
disjunction over the 111 PMIDs the dashboard cites, so recall is exact rather
than sampled and never meets PubMed's 9,999-record `esearch` cap -- it bounds a
result set that can never exceed the gold set. `recall_gold.csv` holds the same
111 PMIDs for the generic harness, and `recall_baseline.json` the figure the
last `scripts.measure_recall --write-baseline` recorded.

It retrieves **106 of 111**. The third branch, `MESH_TERMS AND GENETIC_TERMS`,
reaches papers that never write the disease name out in the title or abstract
and recovers 32 of the 111 on its own; its genetics gate is what keeps
`"White Matter"[MeSH]` from quadrupling ingestion. The two Title/Abstract
branches both `AND` on `"cerebral small vessel disease"[Title/Abstract]`, which
is therefore the ceiling on them: the ten `GENETIC_TERMS` and seven
`MARKER_TERMS` are precision filters and **contribute no recall at all**, and a
test pins that so widening either list in the belief that it helps fails loudly.

The five misses are the same five at gold sets of 29, 32 and 111 papers, which
is the strongest evidence the suite has produced that they are properties of
those papers rather than of the query. They are pinned with a reason each in
`_MISSED`.

Retrieval precision is not measured. The argument for the MeSH branch is a
volume argument -- 43% more papers for six more gold ones -- not a relevance
one. Nothing says what fraction of those ~263 extra papers a year is signal, and
settling it needs relevance judgments over a sample.

## Extraction recall

`tests/pipeline/csvd/test_extraction_golden.py` replays locally recorded
cassettes (CI skips it) and asserts recall over the gold genes each paper's
_retrieved text actually names_:

| Subset                      | Recall          |
| --------------------------- | --------------- |
| genes named in the prompt   | 19/20 = **95%** |
| genes the prompt never says | 23/26 = **88%** |
| pooled                      | 42/46 = **91%** |

**Quote the 88%** -- the clean subset is the one that measures extraction rather
than recall of the prompt. 13 of the 36 gold genes are named verbatim in the
rendered v7 prompt -- the `<example>` blocks that name them live in `prompt.md`,
not the template in `pipeline/prompts.py` -- six of them with their expected
trait and confidence, and `test_the_prompt_names_part_of_its_own_answer_key`
pins that count so a prompt edit naming another gold gene fails instead of
quietly inflating the figure.

These figures are from the 2026-09-11 re-record, against fixtures refetched
through the current Europe PMC parser. The recording before it measured two
points lower (81% clean, 87% pooled) and the one before that the same as now:
one paper gains or loses two genes the prompt never names from one recording to
the next, with the model, prompt version and effort unchanged -- the
nondeterminism the suite is built around rather than a regression to chase.

Raw set-F1 measures about 0.40, for reasons that are mostly not extraction: 23%
of gold gene-paper pairs name a gene that is not in the retrieved text at all,
and the gold standard is a curated table whose rows are the genes the curators
judged causal, not every gene a paper implicates. Still unmeasured: the Docling
PDF path (no gold PMID takes it), negative cases (no gold row reports zero
genes), and anything downstream of `extract_from_paper`, which runs before the
confidence gate and NCBI validation.

## How to cite

The citation is not settled yet: `about.citation` in `manifest.json` is `null`,
and the About page says so. The scientific board, the contact text and the
acknowledgements are `null` for the same reason.
