    """Build the SDK client, honouring an identity-linked API key.

    An identity-linked key does not imply a workspace, so the API rejects
    every request with a 400 -- "anthropic-workspace-id is required" --
    until one is named. The SDK reads ANTHROPIC_WORKSPACE_ID only on its
    Workload-Identity path: with ANTHROPIC_API_KEY set, the credential
    chain short-circuits before reaching it (see step 2a in the SDK's
    lib/credentials/_chain.py, "API keys are not Bearer tokens, so they
    can't flow through this chain"). So the workspace has to travel as a
    request header instead.

    Unset is the normal case -- a workspace-scoped key carries its own
    workspace -- and then no header is sent at all.

    Raising here rather than letting the SDK fail keeps the message on the
    thing an operator actually has to fix, several frames earlier.

    **`max_retries` is left at the SDK's default of 2, and that is a
    decision.** The SDK retries 408, 409, 429 and every 5xx inside
    `client.send()`, before any pipeline branch runs, so those attempts are
    counted neither as calls nor as retries -- see the note on
    `_ANTHROPIC_SERVICE`. Setting it to 0 would make the inventory exact,
    and it is not done because the pipeline's own retry paths do not cover
    the same ground: `_is_retryable_status_error` retries only 529 and the
    mid-stream 200, so a 500 or 503 would become fatal on the first
    attempt, and `messages.batches.retrieve` -- polled for up to 24 hours
    with no retry wrapper at all -- would abort a submitted batch on one
    transient 502. Buying exact telemetry with lost papers is the wrong
    trade; the undercount is documented instead, in `pipeline/CLAUDE.md`
    under "API telemetry".
